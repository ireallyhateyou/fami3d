# fami3d
3d engine for the NES/Famicon in pure HTML5. Since it is HTML5, you can easily self-host it. Use the library menu (â˜°) to test a selection of FOSS ROMs.

# Credits
The idea of the voxel engine (by separating the background colour from the tiles and then adding the sprite layers) was adopted from a FCEUX plugin: https://github.com/HerbFargus/FCE3D

This also uses jsnes for emulation.
